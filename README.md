# Laravel Bootcamp<br>
<br>
Following these instructions: https://bootcamp.laravel.com/livewire/installation<br><br>

Setting up a modern Laravel application from scratch. <br>To explore the framework, I'll build a microblogging platform called Chirper.<br>

Livewire is a full-stack framework for Laravel that allows you to build dynamic UI components without leaving PHP.<br>

I also installed Laravel Breeze, a minimal, simple implementation of all of Laravel's authentication features, <br>
including login, registration, password reset, email verification, and password confirmation.<br>
